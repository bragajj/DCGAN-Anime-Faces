Pokemon Uranium as of 5/1/2020. Some images are missing from being "corrupt" when saving. Has pokemon, mega forms, event forms (anniversary, easter, etc), and a small select shiny forms

Pokemon Empyrean 1.0, the pokemon from /Graphics/Battlers

Special versions of pokemon from Pokemon Insurgence

Pokemon Solar Light & Lunar Dark as of 5/2/2020

Pokemon Sage. It appears like this game hasn't been released yet. Some images had a white background and couldn't be used. Every pokemon from here begins with "sage." This set was done manually, so there may be typos.

I've removed any images smaller than 80x80, and larger than 160x160. I've also removed all images where width and height were not equal
